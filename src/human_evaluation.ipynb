      "2:  The answer is that all the coefficients of odd indices are zero. This is because the function is a polynomial of degree $n$ in $x$, and the coefficient of $x^{n+1}$ in a polynomial is always zero. Therefore, we can write the function as $a_n x^n + b_nx^{n-1} + \\cdots + c_nx + d$, where $b_n, c_n$ and $d$ are polynomials of degree less than $n$. Since $f$ is paired, we know that $d=0$, and since $f(0)\\neq 0$, we must have $c_n=0$. Therefore, all the odd-indexed coefficients are zero, and we only need to show that the even-index coefficients are also zero.

The result of applying mapTr to the head is y, which we append to the end of ys using the append function from the NilAppend lemma. The second part, xs, is also appended to ys in the same way. This gives us y :: xs as the result of the right-hand-side of the original equation. Finally, we use the ConsAppend lemma to concatenate y and xs into a single list.

Therefore, the time complexity of listing files in a directory is proportional to the number of entries in that directory.
