Therefore, we cannot conclude that if a function is differentiable, it must be continuous.\n2. The statement is true. This follows from the definition of differentiability, which requires that the limit of the difference quotient exists. If the limit exists, then the function must be differentiable. However, if the limit does not exist, then we cannot say anything about the differentiability of the function. Therefore, it is possible to have a function that is not twice differentiable but has a limit of its derivative at a point.\n4. This is also true. If a function has a finite number of derivatives, then it is bounded on any compact subset of its domain. This can be proven by using the mean value theorem for integrals.\n6. This also holds true. The derivative of a function can be bounded by the function itself, so if the function is bounded, then its derivative must also be bounded.\n7.

We can then use this estimate to calculate the total consumption of cheese in Switzerland by multiplying it by the total population of Switzerland. This estimator is efficient because it only asks a small number of people, and it has a high success probability because we are taking an average of many random numbers. To analyze this estimator, we can use Chebyshev's inequality, which states that the probability of a random variable being more than a certain amount away from its expected value is at most the expected value of the variable divided by that amount. In our case, the probability that our estimate is more than $\\epsilon W$ away from the true value is bounded by $\\delta$, which is the desired success probability.",

When we reach a leaf node (i.e., a node that has no neighbors), we return the distance to that node as the answer. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the graph, because we visit each node at most twice (once as a source and once as a sink). However, the space complexity can be quite high, depending on the size of the graph and the data structure used to store the visited nodes. For example, if we use a priority queue to keep track of the nodes we need to visit, we may need to store up to n nodes in memory at any given time, which can quickly become infeasible for large graphs. To avoid this issue, we could use a different data structure, such as a hash table or a binary heap, which would allow us to store only the nodes that are currently being explored.

Therefore, we can conclude that the value of f(x0) is well defined.\n2), we can use the definition of the derivative to show that as h approaches 0, the ratio of the difference of the function evaluated at x0 and x0 - h to h approaches f'(x0).\n3), we use the fact that the derivative of a sum is equal to the sum of the derivatives. We can then apply this to the expression on the left-hand side of the equation to obtain the desired result.\n4), this statement is true because the limit of a ratio of two functions as one of the functions approaches a point is the quotient of the limits of the two functions. In this case, we have f(z) as the numerator, which approaches 1 as z approaches x0, so the limit is 1\/1 = 1. The denominator is f'(z), which is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of f at the point x0. As x0 approaches the point, the slope approaches infinity, so we can take the limit to infinity and obtain 0\/infinity = 0.\n5), this is a consequence of the mean value theorem, which states that for any continuous function f on a closed interval [a, b], there exists a point c in the interval such",
