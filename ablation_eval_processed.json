This function is continuous, but it is not differentiable at the point \\(x=0\\). Therefore, we cannot conclude that if a function is differentiable, it must be continuous.\n2. The statement is true. This follows from the definition of differentiability, which requires that the limit of the difference quotient exists. If the limit exists, then the function must be differentiable. However, if the limit does not exist, then we cannot say anything about the differentiability of the function. Therefore, it is possible to have a function that is not twice differentiable but has a limit of its derivative at a point.\n4. This is also true. If a function has a finite number of derivatives, then it is bounded on any compact subset of its domain. This can be proven by using the mean value theorem for integrals.\n6. This also holds true. The derivative of a function can be bounded by the function itself, so if the function is bounded, then its derivative must also be bounded.\n7.

We start at the source and mark it as visited. Then, we recursively explore all the neighbors of the current node, marking them as visited as we go. When we reach a leaf node (i.e., a node that has no neighbors), we return the distance to that node as the answer. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the graph, because we visit each node at most twice (once as a source and once as a sink). However, the space complexity can be quite high, depending on the size of the graph and the data structure used to store the visited nodes. For example, if we use a priority queue to keep track of the nodes we need to visit, we may need to store up to n nodes in memory at any given time, which can quickly become infeasible for large graphs. To avoid this issue, we could use a different data structure, such as a hash table or a binary heap, which would allow us to store only the nodes that are currently being explored. However, these data structures may have different time and space complexities, so it's important to choose the right one for the specific problem at hand.",

    "model_answer":"The answer is option 2 because increasing the bandwidth of an NMR spectrometer can improve the signal-to-noise ratio, but it can also lead to phase cancellation and worsen chemical shift effects. Phase cancellation occurs when the frequency of the RF pulse used to excite the nuclei is close to the Larmor frequency, which can cause the signal to cancel out. Chemical shift effects occur due to the interaction between the magnetic field and the nuclear spins, which results in a shift of the resonance frequency. Increasing the frequency bandwidth can lead to a broader range of chemical shifts, making it more difficult to accurately assign peaks to specific nuclei.",

    "model_answer":"To answer the question, we first need to understand the definition of a positive definite matrix. A matrix $A$ is positive definite if for any non-zero vector $x$, the scalar $x^TAx$ is non-negative. In other words, if $Ax \\neq 0$, then $\\|Ax\\|^2 \\geq 0,$ where $\\|x\\|$ is the Euclidean norm of $x$.\n\nUsing this definition, we can prove the three statements. For part (a), we assume that $\\det{A}>0$ and $a\\geq0$. Then, we have $\\det(A)=\\frac{a^2+d^2}{2}\\geq0$, which implies that $Q=\\frac{1}{2}x^T Ax$ is also positive definite for any $x\\neq0$. This means that if $a=0$ or $d=0$, we cannot have $Q>0$. Therefore, part (b) is true. Similarly, for part (c), if $\\det {A}<0$ then $\\det (A)=-\\frac{ad}{a+d}\\leq0$. Hence, $Q=-\\frac 12 x^TA x$ is negative definite, which means that it is indeterminate for $x=0$. Thus, we get part (d).",

    "model_answer":"The answer is that the bandgap of bilayer MoS2 under strain is expected to increase. This is because the strain causes the atoms to move closer together, which changes the energy levels of the electrons in the material. This results in a decrease in the energy required to excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band, which in turn leads to an increase in the band gap. The same principle applies to bilayer TMDs, such as MoSe2 and MoTe2.",

    "model_answer":"Weak duality is always true because it is a consequence of the definition of the Lagrangian dual function. The dual function of a function $f$ is defined as $d(x) = \\max _{\\lambda \\geq 0} x^T \\lambda - f(\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is a vector of Lagrange multipliers and $x$ is an argument of $f$. Weak duality means that the optimal solution of the dual problem is feasible for the primal problem, and vice versa. In other words, if we can find a feasible solution $\\mathbf{y}^{\\star}$ to the dual optimization problem, then we can also find an optimal solution $x^{\\star}$ of the original primal optimization problem. Conversely, if there exists a primal optimal solution $\\hat{x}$, then there also exists a dual feasible point $\\hat{\\lambda}$ that attains the optimal value of $d$. Therefore, we can conclude that weak dualities always hold.",

In this case, the mean is the expected number of photons in the cavity, and the deviations are the fluctuations around that mean. Therefore, the variance can be expressed as the sum of the squares of these deviations, divided by the total number of possible deviations. Since there are two possible values for each deviation (0 or 1), there are 2^2 = 4 possible combinations of deviations that contribute to the variance. Each of these combinations has a square of 1, so the total variance is 4 \\* 1 = 1.",
