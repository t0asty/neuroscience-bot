We will ask each person $3$ questions about their fondue preferences and randomly select one of the answers for each question.

By randomly selecting the answers, we can reduce the chance of any one person giving the same answer to all three questions, thus reducing the chance that our estimator will be wrong. \n\nWe can then analyze the success probability of the proposed estimator by using the Chernoff bound. By using the fact that the number of questions is at most 3 and that each question has a probability of 0.33 to get the wrong answer, we have that $\\Pr[\\left|Y-W\\right|\\geq\\epsilon W]\\leq\\delta$. Plugging in $\\epsilon=1/\\sqrt{3}$ and $\\delta=0.01$ gives us the desired result."

This is because the projection is a linear transformation, which preserves the direction of vectors, and the equation for the projection plane is \\(\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w}=0\\). Therefore, any vector perpendicular to the plane will have a zero dot product with the vector in the plane, and thus the associated matrix will be the identity."
