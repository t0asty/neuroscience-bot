Similarly, ininformation extraction tasks, lexical links can help identify entities and relations between them, which can then be used to extract structured information from the text. In text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis or topic classification, coherent structures in the text can help the model to better understand the context and thus improve the accuracy of the classification. Finally, for text generation tasks, like machine translation or text-to-speech synthesis, having an understanding of the lexical relationships between words can help generate more natural output."
