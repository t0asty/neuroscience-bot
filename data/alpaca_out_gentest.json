In text classification tasks, it can help to identify words or phrases that are associated with a particular class, allowing for more accurate classification. In synthesis tasks, like text to speech or text to image, it helps to generate more natural sounding output by taking into account the context of the words being spoken or drawn. Question answering tasks can use it to better understand the relationships between words and generate more accurate answers. Finally, text generation tasks can leverage it to generate text that is more grammatically and syntactically correct."
