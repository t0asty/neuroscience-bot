    "answer":"Because the power in the line is Alternating Current, the voltage is constantly fluctuating between 0 and a few hundred thousand volts. \n\nBasically, as the voltage hits the maximum, the electric field around the wire interacting with the environment makes a 'snap' sound. Since this is happening either 50 or 60 times per second(depending on where you live), you get a 50 or 60hz buzzing noise. ",

    "answer":"As another poster said, your muscles contract in pulses, so when weights get heavy (relative to your normal) your muscles tremble, but this can also be caused by fatigue. If the fibers have contracted (or have been contracting) with sustained weight, when you reach a point that it can\u2019t sustain it with that steady wave-like patterns anymore, the nerves in your muscles start firing between waves to squeeze a little bit more strength out of the muscle.",

When your lips are pursed and going \u201coooh\u201d, the air that comes out has a narrower exit point which increases the air\u2019s speed thus decreasing temperature. When opened, there\u2019s a larger exit point thus slower speed and maintaining heat. Basically, the faster the speed, the faster the cooling. ",

What games do in real time is load a dymanic group of prerendered images based on camera positioning and user input.\n\nEvery image you see is prerendered animations that are linked together by the rules that make up the game code (ie \"when player does 'this', load 'that' game asset\/animation\", or \"when player moved to 'this' location, load 'that' game asset or animation\").

    "answer":"The vast majority of transactions don't involve the security code. The magnetic strip of the card doesn't have it and if you imprint the card you won't get a copy of it\n\nThis makes the security code actually somewhat secure since it's less likely to get picked up during everyday transactions. It's only used in transactions where the card isn't present\n\nIt's not great but it's good enough. No point trying to make a perfect security system, none exist",
