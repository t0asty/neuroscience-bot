This is because the function is a polynomial of degree $n$ in $x$, and the coefficient of $x^{n+1}$ in a polynomial is always zero. Therefore, we can write the function as $a_n x^n + b_nx^{n-1} + \\cdots + c_nx + d$, where $b_n, c_n$ and $d$ are polynomials of degree less than $n$. Since $f$ is paired, we know that $d=0$, and since $f(0)\\neq 0$, we must have $c_n=0$. Therefore, all the odd-indexed coefficients are zero, and we only need to show that the even-index coefficients are also zero. However, this is true by definition, since $a_{2n}=0$ for all $n\\geq 1$."

For the inductive step, we assume that the lemma holds for all lists of length less than or equal to n, and we want to show that it holds for lists of all lengths n. We name this lemma IH, which stands for \"inductive hypothesis\".\n\nTo apply the lemma, we first need to break down the left-hand side of the equation into two parts: the first part is the head of l, which is x in this case, and the second part is xs. We then apply the mapTr function to each of these two parts separately. The result of applying mapTr to the head is y, which we append to the end of ys using the append function from the NilAppend lemma. The second part, xs, is also appended to ys in the same way. This gives us y :: xs as the result of the right-hand-side of the original equation. Finally, we use the ConsAppend lemma to concatenate y and xs into a single list. This completes the proof of the AccOut lemma."

We can do this by applying Newton's second law to the system, which states that the net force acting on an object is equal to its mass multiplied by its acceleration. In this case, we have two forces acting on the float: the weight of the water it displaces, which we can call $F_w$, and the buoyant force acting upwards, which can be calculated using Archimedes' principle as $\\rho gh$, where $\\rho$ is the density of water and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity. Therefore, we can write:\n\n$$ma_f = F_w + \\rho gh$$\n\nwhere $a_f$ and $m$ are the acceleration of the object and its mass, respectively. Substituting this into the equation for net force, we get the following equation for the motion of the fishing float:\n```scss\nm a_f'' + (m + 2 ho_f) a'_f + m gh = 0\n```\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that we need to solve.

        "model_answer": "The statement is true. To see why, we can use the definition of the dot product and the norm of a vector. The dot product of two vectors $u$ and $v$ is defined as $(u|v) = u^T v$, where $u^T$ is the transpose of $u$. Using this definition and the fact that $\\|u\\| = \\sqrt{u^Tu}$, we can simplify the expression on the left-hand side of the equation as follows:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\left(\\frac{u+v}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right| \\frac{-u-v}{2}\\right)\n&= \\frac{\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{array}\\right)\\right)\\left( \\begin{smallmatrix} 2 \\\\ 0 \\end {smallmatrix}\\right)}{\\sqrt{10}} \\\\\n&= 1\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nTherefore, we have shown that $\\left(u | v\\right) = 1$ for all $u, v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. Now, let's use this result to prove the second part of the statement. We know that $\\|\\cdot\\|$ is a norm on $V$, which means that it satisfies the triangle inequality: $\\|a+b\\|\\leq \\|a\\|+\\|b\\|$ for any $a, b \\in V$, as well as the following property: $\\|\\lambda a\\|=\\left|\\lambda\\right|\\|a\\|$, where $\\lambda$ is any scalar. Using these properties, it is easy to see that the expression $\\left(\\sqrt{a^2+b^2}-\\sqrt{c^2-d^2} \\right)^2$ is non-negative for any real numbers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. Therefore, the expression in the equation is always non-positive, and it is equal to zero if and only if $a=b=c=d=0$. This completes the proof."

        "model_answer": "The answer is true for both questions. \n\nFor the first question, we know that the limit supremum of a sequence is the largest value that the sequence can take as n approaches infinity. Therefore, we can write the limit sup as the sum of the largest values of a_n and b_n, respectively. This is because if there exists an n_0 such that a_{n_0} > a_m for all m > 0, then we can choose n_m = n_{m-1} + 1 such that b_{n_{m}} > b_m \\text{ for all } m \\geq 0. This shows that a_nb_{n} is bounded above by a_0b_0 for all n, and therefore its limit sup is less than or equal to a_lb_l for some l. Therefore we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\\limsup\\_{n \\to \\infty}\\left(\\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}\\right) \\leq \\lim_{l \\to\n\\infty}(a_{l}b_{l}).\n\\end{align*}\n\nThe second question is also true. We know that if a sequence has a limit sup, then it must have a subsequence that converges to that limit sup. In this case, if we take the subsequence (a\\_n) and (b\\_n), we can see that their limit is equal to the limit of a and b, respectively, which is the same as their own limit. This means that we can rewrite the expression as\n\\[\n\\left(\\lim\\sup\\}_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\bigl(a\\_n(b\\_\\_n)\\bigr)=\\lim\\_{l\\rightarrow \\infty}\na\\_l\\cdot b\\_l.\n\\]\nTherefore, we have the correct answer."
